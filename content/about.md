# Hi!

I hold a PhD in computer science from the University of Manchester. I was studying in the field of complex networks which doesn't fit neatly into any single domain---both my examiners were mathematicians and I hold a master's degree in theoretical physics. You may read my thesis [here](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/characterisation-of-complex-networks-from-their-topologies(1febf479-d9a5-4301-9bb9-beb7f5cbcc4e).html). My supervisor was Dr Eva Navarro-LÃ³pez[^Eva].

As part of my master's degree I worked with Ksenia Grozdova under Sue Astley on a project measuring mammographic density using computer vision techniques. (Before DeepMind made it [cool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6).

You can view my GitHub repository at https://github.com/bovine3dom where you will find a small project I wrote for a C++ class, the code for the mammographic density estimation and, most importantly, my dotfiles. You might also stumble across [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), a weirdly popular niche Firefox extension I develop alongside an extraordinary number of other people. I generally programme in Python and Julia[^Julia]. These days, because of Tridactyl, I write quite a lot of TypeScript too. I wouldn't say that was strictly by choice.
