# Hi!

I'm a [recovering physicist](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-03-21). I've researched patterns of academic collaboration, changes in the English language, computer-aided mammography, differences in software dependency networks and similarities between food webs, patterns of communication between suffragettes and air-traffic networks. I'm now most widely known for [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), an incredibly niche extension for the Firefox web browser and [Interiors for CUP](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1883956552), a modification for a modification for ArmA, a military simulation game.

I hold a PhD in computer science from the University of Manchester. I was studying in the field of complex networks which doesn't fit neatly into any single domain---both my examiners were mathematicians and I hold a master's degree in theoretical physics. You may read my thesis [online on the University of Manchester's website](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/characterisation-of-complex-networks-from-their-topologies(1febf479-d9a5-4301-9bb9-beb7f5cbcc4e).html). My supervisor was Dr Eva Navarro-LÃ³pez[^Eva].

As part of my master's degree I worked with Ksenia Grozdova under Sue Astley on a project measuring mammographic density using computer vision techniques. (Before DeepMind made it [cool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6)).

You can view my GitHub repository at https://github.com/bovine3dom where you will find a small project I wrote for a C++ class, the code for the mammographic density estimation and, most importantly, my dotfiles. You might also stumble across [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), a weirdly popular niche Firefox extension I develop alongside an extraordinary number of other people. I generally programme in Python and Julia[^Julia]. These days, because of Tridactyl, I write quite a lot of TypeScript too. I wouldn't say that was strictly by choice.

I've recently done some consulting work with a friend for a transport consultancy, building an open source tool to help explain the outputs of models of interventions. The tool can be seen here: https://github.com/IntegratedTransportPlanning/gcvt.

# Contact

You can contact me at oliver---at---blanthorn---.---com. My PGP fingerprint is 15D0 3C86 8379 36A0 (which is attached to a email address I chose in 2005), probably most easily found at [Keybase](https://keybase.io/bovine3dom), also available on the MIT and Ubuntu keyservers.
